 * \ingroup docsis
 * \brief Helper code for constructing DOCSIS simulations
 *
 * This helper is used to add a DOCSIS link between a pair of
 * nodes, one notional CMTS node and one notional CM node.  It
 * installs a CmtsNetDevice and a CmNetDevice on the nodes, but does
 * not install any other nodes or links.  The CmNetDevice and CmtsNetDevice
 * are L2 bridged devices; the user of this helper must bridge
 * them to another device on the same node.
 *
 * This helper also provides methods to install and configure the dual queue
 * and queue protection objects, and also to install selected applications
 * on client and server nodes.
 *
 * This helper does not maintain internal state and is primarily designed
 * around the Install() helper pattern in use in other parts of the
 * ns-3 code.  Another helper (DocsisScenarioHelper) is stateful and
 * constructs a larger network with client and server application nodes.
