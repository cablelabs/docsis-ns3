enable this docsis module.  The patch name contains the changeset
of ns-3-dev that the patch is known to work with (it may work also
for later changesets).

For example, ns-3-dev-a30639fc.patch means that the version of ns-3-dev
at commit a30639fc (April 29, 2020), is known to work.

The ns-3.31.patch applies to the ns-3.31 release.  The ns-3.32.patch applies
