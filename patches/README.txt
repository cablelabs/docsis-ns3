This directory contains temporary patches for ns-3 mainline code to
enable this docsis module.  The patch name contains the changeset
of ns-3-dev, or the released version, that the patch is known to work with
(it may work also for later changesets).

For example, ns-3-dev-a30639fc.patch means that the version of ns-3-dev
at commit a30639fc (April 29, 2020), is known to work.

For the numbered releases (3.31, 3.32, 3.33, 3.34, 3.35, 3.38, 3.39),
the ns-3.3x.patch applies
to the respective ns-3.3x release.  To apply to the development version of
ns-3 (ns-3-dev), please use the most recent release patch.

In future revisions, this patch is expected to go away once the code
in the patch is accepted to the ns-3 mainline or else brought into this
model directory.
